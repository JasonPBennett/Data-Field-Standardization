This repository contains code intended to process distinct age data. The file "age_queried.tsv"
contains that data. The scripts folder contains the following two scripts:

NORMALIZE.PY
normalize.py preprocesses the queried data and outputs age_normalized.tsv. Right now it just
lowercases the age field and converts en- and em-dashes to hyphens, but it might do more later.

AGE_PROCESS.PY
age_process.py intakes age_normalized.tsv and sorts the free-text data into columns for specified 
age, minimum age, maximum age, age unit, and age comment. It produces three output files:
	- age_output.tsv, which contains all data contained in the original file;
	- age_sorted.tsv, which contains only the data that could be processed/sorted by the script; and
	- age_unsorted.tsv, which contains only the data that could not be processed/sorted by the script 
	  and will need to be manually sorted.
Each file has an index column which contains a unique identifier that is the same across all three 
TSVs, e.g., #400 on age_output.tsv is the same line of data as #400 on age_sorted.tsv.

More coming soon...
